Let's do some stats!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
optical_full <- read_excel(file.path(base_dir, "Data/optical_full.xlsx"))
```

We view this set as **population** data (it includes all the data of interest). More typically, we only have **sample** data, that is, a subset of the population, typically a random one.

Let's get a random sample of size n = 10 and compare it to the population.

```{r}
set.seed(0) # to reset the RNG using seed 0
optical_sample <- optical_full %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 10)
```

Let's compute means and sds of `Age`.

```{r}
mean(optical_full$Age)
mean(optical_sample$Age)

sd(optical_full$Age)
sd(optical_sample$Age)
```


A number describing a sample is called a **statistic** and a number describing a population is called a **parameter**.

**Statistical inference** is the process of drawing conclusions about parameters from statistics.

We need to take variability into account because if we re-run the sample, we'll almost certainly get different statistics.

```{r}
set.seed(1)

optical_sample2 <- optical_full %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 10)

mean(optical_sample2$Age)
```

A **level C confidence interval** is an interval created  using sample data that using a process that is known to capture the true value of the paramter C percent of the time.

In an introductory stats class, we learn to do this with a t-distribution. Here is the formula:

$$
\mu = \overline{x} \pm t_* \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

Where s is the sample standard deviation, n is the sample size, and $t_*$ is computed from the confidence level C. Bigger values for higher levels of confidence. 

In R we do this using the `t.test()` function.

```{r}
t.test(optical_sample$Age, 
       conf.level = 0.95)
```

We can change the confidence level but in general you don't need to.
