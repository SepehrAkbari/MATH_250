# Question

Refer to the scat data set from the modeldata package. Explore this set visually for patterns
and associations between variables, then write a short narrative with 1-2 conclusions. Create
at least 3 clear and interesting plots which support those conclusions. You may need to do a
small amount of outside reading to learn what the relevant variables are and how they might
be interpreted. Such information should be included in your narrative.

Note: I recommend against using time as a variable in this assignment as itâ€™s split between
two columns
